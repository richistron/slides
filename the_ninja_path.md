# What?

<!-- Maybe what I'm sayig right know doesn't make sense -->

    So let's provide some perspective on
    what I'm talking about

    This is has been my path so far:

# My first program

    I'm a Genius

![genius](https://media.giphy.com/media/eMu0803X2zkWY/giphy.gif)

<!-- But it turns out my first program
was crap -->
<!-- I was saving images for revista moto -->
<!-- inside the data base -->
<!-- I used call myself a consultant -->

# Then I joined LinuxCabal

    Maybe I'm not smart at all

<!-- for those who don't know what linux -->
<!-- cabal is, is a community of linux lover -->
<!-- here in guadalajara -->

<!-- I got to realize that I'm was not as -->
<!-- smart as I thought I was, I was just -->
<!-- really an low average developer -->

<!-- Some random dude called me stupid the -->
<!-- first time I went to Linux cabal -->

<!-- he called me stupid because I asked what -->
<!-- was MVC -->

<!-- I'm a mechanic engineer -->

# We are very good friends

<!-- with him and a few other folks we -->
<!-- started hacker garage -->

# Am I a genius now?

<!-- I a genius now? -->

<!-- I started buying online curses and books -->
<!-- and I used every weekend to get better -->
<!-- and better -->

<!-- I forced myself to be the best -->

<!-- I realized I was not the best and that's -->
<!-- not acceptable -->

# I was punishing myself to the limit
